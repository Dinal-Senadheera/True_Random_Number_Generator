# True_Random_Number_Generator
Random number generators currently present in computers have a certain pattern and if studied enough can be predicted. This could be very fatal if the security requirement is very high
For something to be truly random it should not be interefered in any way. So to make this happen, cosmic flux values are taken from a device intended to read those values and put into a data file
Then according to the user's choice four, six or eight values are taken from the data file checked to see if the number is even or odd then converted to a binary put together then again converted to decimal to generate a true random number.
